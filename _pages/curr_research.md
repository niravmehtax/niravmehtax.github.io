## Revise and Resubmit :house: :arrow_right: :house_with_garden:

 * [Optimal Contracting with Altruistic Agents: Medicare Payments for Dialysis Drugs](/files/research/medicare_screening_2022_09.pdf) (9/2022),
with [Martin Gaynor](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mgaynor/) and [Seth Richards-Shubik](http://www.lehigh.edu/~ser315/). 
NBER Working Paper 27172.  
**Conditionally accepted at the *American Economic Review*.**

  	<p>
  	We study health care provider agency and optimal payment policy in the context of an expensive medication for dialysis patients. 
	Using Medicare claims data we estimate a structural model of treatment decisions, in which providers differ in their altruism and marginal costs, and this heterogeneity is unobservable to the government. 
	In a novel application of nonlinear pricing methods, we empirically characterize the optimal unrestricted contracts in this screening environment with multidimensional heterogeneity. 
	The optimal contracts initially pay similar amounts as the one used by Medicare at the time, but the marginal payment rates decline precipitously at higher dosages. 
	Adopting the optimal contracts would eliminate medically excessive dosages and substantially reduce expenditures, resulting in approximately $300 million in gains from better contracting. 
	The approach we develop could be applied to a broad class of problems in health care payment policy.

* [Social Interactions, Mechanisms, and Equilibrium: Evidence from a Model of Study Time and Academic Achievement](/files/research/CMSS_social_interactions_study_wp.pdf) (02/2023), 
with [Tim Conley](https://economics.uwo.ca/people/faculty/conley.html), Ralph Stinebrickner, and [Todd Stinebrickner](https://economics.uwo.ca/people/faculty/stinebrickner.html). 
CESifo Working Paper 6896; NBER Working Paper 21418.  
**Accepted at the *Journal of Political Economy*.**

  	<p>
  	We develop and estimate a model of student study time on a social network. 
  	The model is designed to exploit unique data collected in the Berea Panel Study. 
  	Study time data allow us to quantify an intuitive mechanism for academic social interactions: own study time may depend on friend study time in a heterogeneous manner. 
  	Social network data allow us to embed study time and resulting academic achievement in an estimable equilibrium framework. 
  	We develop a specification test that exploits the equilibrium nature of social interactions and use it to show that novel study propensity measures mitigate econometric endogeneity concerns.

## Working Papers :derelict_house: :arrow_right: :house:

* [A Partial Identification Approach to Identifying the Determinants of Human Capital Accumulation: An Application to Teachers](/files/research/mehta_OJT_LBD_teachers_partial_identification_working_paper.pdf) (1/2023). CESifo Working Paper 9681. Funded by SSHRC IDG Grant 430-2020-01098.  
Under review.

  	<summary>Abstract</summary>  
	<p>
	Teacher quality exhibits substantial growth over teachersâ€™ careers, but why it improves is not well understood.
	I use a human capital production function nesting On-the-Job-Training (OJT) and Learning-by-Doing (LBD) and experimental variation from Glewwe et al. (2010), a teacher incentive pay experiment in Kenya, to discern the presence and relative importance of these forces.
	The identified set for the OJT and LBD components has a closed-form solution, which depends on experimentally estimated average treatment effects.
	I find that the LBD component is indeed present in the human capital production function, and also estimate an informative upper bound on the OJT component.

## Needing Resurrection :derelict_house:

These are zombie papers, but instead of regular zombies (which need only brains), these need time from me and/or someone else (you?!)...

* Supply, Demand, and Social Learning: An Application to Learning About Charter School Quality 
{%comment%} (with Matt Chingos) {%endcomment%}

* The Impact of Primary Health Care Reform on Population Health: Theory and Evidence from Ontario 
{%comment%} (with Sisira Sarma) {%endcomment%}

## Number of Papers at Each Stage

* This chart summarizes the number of papers at different stages (e.g., "under review" or "accepted"). 
(Note: the number of working papers ("dev. wp") isn't very accurate for the earlier periods because I hadn't been tracking that. 
Also, there are some invisible zombies.)

## Research Tools

* Programming, listed in order of decreasing start-up time (for me):

	* [R](https://www.r-project.org/): Free, reasonably easy to use, and reasonably fast to get started with. Can be slow if you're not super clever. 
	
	* [Julia](): Free, rapidly changing (in my view), and can be pretty speedy if you're clever enough to use it correctly.
	
	* [FORTRAN](https://fortran-lang.org/en/): Free and non-free, and for when you aren't feeling clever but also are feeling like it's [crunch time](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/software/g95_v0.94/G95Manual.pdf)! 
	
* etc.

	* DNS: To remotely access my office machine (to check programs I'm running), I use [Free DNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/), which makes it very easy to ssh into my office machine via a memorable name (which then points to the machine's IP address).
