	This paper views career growth in teacher quality through the lens of human capital theory to understand the roles of On-the-Job Training (OJT) and Learning-by-Doing (LBD) in human capital formation. 
	If OJT is the primary determinant of human capital, incentive pay policies could create a dynamic multitasking problem, leading teachers to reduce their human capital investments, thereby lowering future student achievement. 
	In contrast, teacher human capital and future achievement would both increase if LBD were the dominant force. 
	To explore this, I develop explicit bounds on components of a human capital production function allowing for both channels, which I estimate using experimental variation from Glewwe et al. (2010), a teacher incentive pay experiment in Kenya. 
	I find that LBD is present and also estimate an informative upper bound on the OJT component. 
	This suggests that dynamic multitasking, while theoretically relevant, may have limited practical significance, at least in this context.

  	We develop and estimate a model of student study time on a social network. 
  	The model is designed to exploit unique data collected in the Berea Panel Study. 
  	Study time data allow us to quantify an intuitive mechanism for academic social interactions: own study time may depend on friend study time in a heterogeneous manner. 
  	Social network data allow us to embed study time and resulting academic achievement in an estimable equilibrium framework. 
  	We develop a specification test that exploits the equilibrium nature of social interactions and use it to show that novel study propensity measures mitigate econometric endogeneity concerns.

  	<summary>Abstract</summary>  
  	<p>
  	We study health care provider agency and optimal payment policy in the context of an expensive medication for dialysis patients. 
	Using Medicare claims data we estimate a structural model of treatment decisions, in which providers differ in their altruism and marginal costs, and this heterogeneity is unobservable to the government. 
	In a novel application of nonlinear pricing methods, we empirically characterize the optimal unrestricted contracts in this screening environment with multidimensional heterogeneity. 
	The optimal contracts initially pay similar amounts as the one used by Medicare at the time, but the marginal payment rates decline precipitously at higher dosages. 
	Adopting the optimal contracts would eliminate medically excessive dosages and substantially reduce expenditures, resulting in approximately $300 million in gains from better contracting. 
	The approach we develop could be applied to a broad class of problems in health care payment policy.

	<p>
	Teacher quality exhibits substantial growth over teachers’ careers, but why it improves is not well understood.
	I use a human capital production function nesting On-the-Job-Training (OJT) and Learning-by-Doing (LBD) and experimental variation from Glewwe et al. (2010), a teacher incentive pay experiment in Kenya, to discern the presence and relative importance of these forces.
	The identified set for the OJT and LBD components has a closed-form solution, which depends on experimentally estimated average treatment effects.
	I find that the LBD component is indeed present in the human capital production function, and also estimate an informative upper bound on the OJT component.

## In Progress :building_construction:

* A Quantitative Theory of Teacher Quality: Evidence from a Dynamic Structural Model Estimated using an Incentive Pay Experiment. Funded by SSHRC IDG Grant 430-2020-01098.

  	<p>
	Teacher quality is an important determinant of the distribution of student achievement. Researchers have documented considerable cross-sectional variation in the quality of even novice teachers, but this variation is not well-explained by teachers’ observable characteristics. Although the determinants of teacher quality are not yet well understood, researchers have documented the effects of output-based incentives on teacher quality and substantial growth in teacher quality over teachers’ careers. I combine classic human capital and asymmetric information frameworks to develop an estimable dynamic model of teacher quality. Teacher human capital may be generated by on-the-job investments and/or by learning-by-doing. The model allows for variation in teachers’ initial human capital (hidden types) as well as for teachers to make unobserved effort inputs (hidden actions). I then estimate the model using experimental variation from Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011), a teacher incentive pay experiment in Andhra Pradesh. Preliminary results indicate that hidden human capital types explain the lion’s share of quality variation, and that on-the-job investments are responsible for the majority of teacher quality growth. Under the incentive scheme in Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011), the increase in teacher quality that took place during the intervention is attenuated by the reduction in future quality.

## Needing Resurrection :derelict_house:

These are zombie papers, but instead of regular zombies (which need only brains), these need time from me and/or someone else (you?!)...

* Supply, Demand, and Social Learning: An Application to Learning About Charter School Quality

* The Impact of Primary Health Care Reform on Population Health: Theory and Evidence from Ontario

## Number of Papers at Each Stage

* This chart summarizes the number of papers at different stages (e.g., "under review" or "accepted"). 
(Note: the number of working papers ("dev. wp") isn't very accurate for the earlier periods because I hadn't been tracking that. 
Also, there are some invisible zombies.)

## Research Tools

* Programming, listed in order of decreasing start-up time (for me):

	* [R](https://www.r-project.org/): Free, reasonably easy to use, and reasonably fast to get started with. Can be slow if you're not super clever. 
	
	* [Julia](): Free, rapidly changing (in my view), and can be pretty speedy if you're clever enough to use it correctly.
	
	* [FORTRAN](https://fortran-lang.org/en/): Free and non-free, and for when you don't feel like feeling clever, but also feel like it's [crunch time](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/software/g95_v0.94/G95Manual.pdf)! 
	
	I've compiled a table summarizing which languages I've used in some projects:
		
	| Project Name                    																		    | Fortran 95 | R    | Julia |
	|-------------------------------------|------------|------|-------|
	| Competition in Public School Districts 														| [x]        | [x]  |       |
	| Ability Tracking, School and Parental Effort, and Student Achievement   | [x]        | [x]  |       |
	| Generalizing Findings from Regression-Discontinuity Designs 				| | [x] | |
	| Measuring Quality for Use in Incentive Schemes 										| | [x] | |
	| Optimal Contracting with Altruistic Agents                 								|            | [x]  |       |
	| Social Interactions, Mechanisms, and Equilibrium                  					|            | [x]  |       |
	| Teacher Quality: Partial Identification of Human Capital Technology        |            | [x]  |       |
	| Teacher Quality: Dynamic Structural Model           									|            | [x]  | [x]   |
	| Multidimensional Health              																|            | [x]  |       |

	
* etc.

	* DNS: To remotely access my office machine (to check programs I'm running), I use [Free DNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/), which makes it very easy to ssh into my office machine via a memorable name (which then points to the machine's IP address). 

	* It can be hard to keep track of all the tasks involved with revising a paper (or even undertaking a big project). I sometimes use [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) to track my tasks and [task2dot](https://pypi.org/project/task2dot/), which takes task output from taskwarrior and generates a graph using [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/), to help me figure out how to prioritize my next steps. For example, if many tasks depend on task A it might make the most sense to complete A first; less obvious dependency structures might be easier to understand with the visualization provided by task2dot.
