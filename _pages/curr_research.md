  	<p>
  	We study health care provider agency and optimal payment policy in the context of an expensive medication for dialysis patients. 
Using Medicare claims data we estimate a structural model of treatment decisions, in which physicians differ in their altruism and marginal costs, and this heterogeneity is unobservable to the government. 
In a novel application of nonlinear pricing methods, 
we empirically characterize the optimal unrestricted contract in this screening environment with multidimensional heterogeneity.
The optimal contract is a flexible fee-for-service regime, with variable marginal payment rates. Adopting the optimal contract would eliminate medically excessive dosages and reduce the government's expenditures by 27 percent.

  	<p>
  	We develop and estimate a model of student study time on a social network. 
  	The model is designed to exploit unique data collected in the Berea Panel Study. Study
time data allow us to quantify an intuitive mechanism for academic social interactions:
own study time may depend on friend study time in a heterogeneous manner. Social
network data allow us to embed study time and resulting academic achievement in
an estimable equilibrium framework. We develop a specification test that exploits the
equilibrium nature of social interactions and use it to show that novel study propensity
measures mitigate econometric endogeneity concerns.

## Working Papers :derelict_house: :arrow_right: :house:

* [A Partial Identification Approach to Identifying the Determinants of Human Capital Accumulation: An Application to Teachers](/files/research/mehta_OJT_LBD_teachers_partial_identification_working_paper.pdf) (3/2022). CESifo Working Paper 9681. Funded by SSHRC IDG Grant 430-2020-01098.

	<p>
	This paper views teacher quality through the human capital perspective.
	Teacher quality exhibits substantial growth over teachers' careers, but why it improves is not well understood.
	I use a human capital production function nesting On-the-Job-Training (OJT) and Learning-by-Doing (LBD) and experimental variation from Glewwe et al. (2010), a teacher incentive pay experiment in Kenya, to discern the presence and relative importance of these forces.
	The identified set for the OJT and LBD components has a closed-form solution, which depends on experimentally estimated average treatment effects.
	The results provide evidence of an LBD component, as well as an informative upper bound on the OJT component.
