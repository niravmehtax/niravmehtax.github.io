## Working Papers

* **A Partial Identification Approach to Identifying the Determinants of Human Capital Accumulation: An Application to Teachers.** *Funded by the SSHRC IDG Grant Program.* [working paper (3/30/2022)](/files/research/mehta_OJT_LBD_teachers_partial_identification.pdf)

	This paper views teacher quality through the human capital perspective.
	Teacher quality exhibits substantial growth over teachers' careers, but why it improves is not well understood.
	I use a human capital production function nesting On-the-Job-Training (OJT) and Learning-by-Doing (LBD) and experimental variation from Glewwe et al. (2010), a teacher incentive pay experiment in Kenya, to discern the presence and relative importance of these forces.
	The identified set for the OJT and LBD components has a closed-form solution, which depends on experimentally estimated average treatment effects.
	The results provide evidence of an LBD component, as well as an informative upper bound on the OJT component. 


## In Progress

## Needing Resurrection

These are zombie papers, but instead of regular zombies (which need brains), these need time and/or someone else to take the lead...
