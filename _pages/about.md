I am an applied/labor economist at the University of Western Ontario. 
Some of my [current research](/curr_research) is about contracting in health care and education, the determinants of teacher quality, and social interaction models.

I did my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Before that, I did an M.Sc. in Economics at the London School of Economics and my (dual) B.A. is from the University of South Carolina, in Economics and International Studies.

Here is my [CV](/files/nirav_mehta_cv.pdf).
