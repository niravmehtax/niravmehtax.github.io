I am an applied/labor economist at the University of Western Ontario.
In my main line of research I develop and estimate models of human behavior to deliver quantitive answers to important public policy questions.
Some of my [current research](/curr_research) in this line is about contracting in [health care](/files/research/medicare_screening_2022_09.pdf) and education, the determinants of teacher quality, and [social interactions models](/files/research/Conley_Mehta_Stinebrickner_Stinebrickner_friendstudy_2022_07_13.pdf).
In prior work, I've studied how [charter school policy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45018807) affects the distribution of student achievement, as well as the determinants and consequences of [ability tracking](https://doi.org/10.1086/697559).

I also use economic theory to help interpret data, even when not explicitly estimating behavioral models.
For example, we can use economic theory to think about how we should [measure teacher quality](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE950), or to complement the statistical machinery typically used to extrapolate estimates of studies based on [regression-discontinuity designs](https://doi.org/10.3368/jhr.54.4.1115.7497R2).

I did my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Before that, I did an M.Sc. in Economics at the London School of Economics and my (dual) B.A. is from the University of South Carolina, in Economics and International Studies.
