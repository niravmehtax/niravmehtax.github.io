I am an applied/labor economist at the University of Western Ontario. 
Some of my [current research](/curr_research) is about contracting in health care and education, the determinants of teacher quality, and social interaction models.

More generally, I use economic theory to interpret data, with the goal of helping improve public policy. 
Most of my research falls under the "structural microeconometrics" research agenda, where I develop and estimate models of human behavior to deliver quantitive answers to policy questions.
For example, I've worked on [optimal contracting](/files/research/medicare_screening_2022_09.pdf) in the presence of multidimensional unobserved heterogeneity among health providers.
In education, I've studied how [charter school policy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45018807) affects the distribution of student achievement, the determinants and consequences of [ability tracking](https://doi.org/10.1086/697559), and how [network structure](/files/research/Conley_Mehta_Stinebrickner_Stinebrickner_friendstudy_2022_07_13.pdf) determines student effort choices and outcomes in education.

I also enjoy thinking through the implications of models, with an eye to help interpret data without explicitly estimating behavioral models.
For example, we can use economic theory to think about how to best [measure teacher quality](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE950), or to complement the statistical machinery typically used to extrapolate estimates of studies based on [regression-discontinuity designs](https://doi.org/10.3368/jhr.54.4.1115.7497R2).

I did my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Before that, I did an M.Sc. in Economics at the London School of Economics and my (dual) B.A. is from the University of South Carolina, in Economics and International Studies.

Here is my [CV](/files/nirav_mehta_cv.pdf).
