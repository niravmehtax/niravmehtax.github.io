I am an applied/labor economist at the University of Western Ontario. 
Some of my [current research](/curr_research) is about contracting in education and health care, teacher incentive schemes, and social interaction models.

I did my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Before that, I did an M.Sc. in Economics at the LSE and my B.A. is from the University of South Carolina, in Economics and International Studies.
